# lissan-imaging-simu
Quick simulation of the LISSAN imaging system

## code
The pieces of code are not yet documented.

To run the code, in SSWIDL, run `lissan_uv_plane_options`.

It will call a few procedures or functions that have been adapted for LISSAN out of the simulation I wrote for STIX and available here: [STIX_imaging_sim](https://github.com/somusset/STIX_imaging_sim).

The rational behind the tool is somewhat explained in the document: [STIX%20imaging%20simulation%20in%20IDL%20V2.pdf](https://github.com/somusset/STIX_imaging_sim/blob/master/doc/STIX%20imaging%20simulation%20in%20IDL%20V2.pdf)
